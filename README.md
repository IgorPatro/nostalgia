# Hey! Welcome to my Nostalgia Project!

### What is it?
This project is a compilation of all my work which is not unfortunately published to the whole world üôÅ. I entirely created the projects, designs, schemas and ideas listed below. Unfortunately, those are only the basic drafts, mainly because clients or even myself sometimes abandoned those projects later on. I want to emphasize that these projects were created by me a long time ago. However, I left them behind so that I could sometimes enjoy the feeling of nostalgia and see how much progress I have made since then üòé. 

### 1. Patrocreations Design

This is the design of my website. The whole file shows the process of creating this project and all ideas used while developing.

### 2. Casa di Tuzza
link: [figma/casadituzza](https://www.figma.com/file/YL1xFkcAqfKXsWGaNi1fOc/Casa-di-Tuzza?node-id=0%3A1)

Casa di Tuzza was a website project with orders management for the restaurant from Warsow. I have already created the basic proposition and technologies showcase. Unfortunately, in the end, the project has just been abandoned.

### 3. Car Rental

Website project, which was ready to start. It was one of my first react projects, so it is very nostalgic <3

### 4. McGrajkowo

I used to be a gamer, so I wanted to create something that could be passionate for me and, at the same time - be profitable. We decided to make a server with my friend. Building it required multiple DevOps and java proficiency skills, so we decided that we could not create it. We have created the whole business structure and the website with payments but all those - sank like a ship.

### 5. Car Detailing

Another abandoned project with cars on the horizon.

### 6. My Library
link: [notion/articles](https://generated-route-b67.notion.site/Programming-7a767344f1444684bde2c334b7efd311)

This is my little library of good programming articles and tricks. I started collecting those in march 2022. I just needed a place where I could store everything, which could be helpful in the future.

<br/>

As you can see, the projects listed above were all created in Figma or Notion. I love those programs, and I thank the developers for creating such great tools every day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
