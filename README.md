# Hey! Welcome to my Nostalgia Project!

### What is it?
This project is a compilation of all my work which is not unfortunately published to the whole world. I entirely created the projects, designs, schemas and ideas listed below. Unfortunately, those are only the basic drafts, mainly because clients or even myself sometimes abandoned those projects later on.

### 1. Patrocreations Design

##### Description
Casa di Tuzza was a website project with orders management for the restaurant from Warsow. I have already created the basic proposition and technologies showcase. Unfortunately, in the end, the project has just been abandoned.






How you can see all those were created with Figma, because I just love this program <3
